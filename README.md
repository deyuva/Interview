Notes:

General:

- Always initiate variables as you add them (loop indecies for example)
- Think deeper about loop conditions including 'OR' 'AND'. 
- INDICIES vs VALUES and KEYS vs VALUES is super importent, take your time when thinking about these.
- When out of bound is possible, use the LEFTEST evaluation in an if statment.
- When working with an index ("i" exl) and comparisons should make sure to compare i to i-1 if goes up and i to i + 1 if goes down.
- IN PLACE can usually mean working with swaps.

2D arrays:
- Bounderies should ALWAYS be considered.
- Pay attention to rows and collums.
- When having multipe conditions, think separately about moving indecies, consider nested loops
